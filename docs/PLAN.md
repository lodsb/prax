# prax build plan

Work one stage per Claude Code session. Each stage ends green: tests pass,
`ruff` clean, and the stage's checklist fully ticked before moving on.
Decisions behind the stages: `docs/rationale.md`. Source details:
`docs/sources.md`.

## Stage 0 — Prove the core

Goal: text in, search and graph out, reachable from Claude Code. No parsers,
no embeddings, no real sources yet; those come in Stage 1 and 2 once this
path is proven.

- [x] `prax.store`: schema init from numbered migrations, WAL on, one process-wide
      lock, connection usable from worker threads (FastAPI and FastMCP both
      run sync handlers off the main thread)
- [x] Two-step ingest: `register` archives the original bytes and inserts
      the document row (hash = sha256 of the original); `index_text` stores
      the parsed text as its own content-addressed artifact, chunks it
      (~1000-char windows, overlap 150) into `chunks` + FTS5, and stamps
      `parsed_at`. `ingest_text` composes both for plain text.
- [x] `get` reads the text artifact (never re-joins overlapping chunks) and
      accepts `offset` / `max_chars`
- [x] `search` (FTS5-only): the store builds the MATCH expression from the
      user string; punctuation and operators in a query never raise
- [x] `link`, `traverse` (recursive CTE, max 2 hops, both edge endpoints
      within the hop limit, valid edges only, result rows carry entity
      types and hop distance)
- [x] FastAPI: `POST /ingest` (text), `POST /ingest/file` (multipart),
      `GET /get/{id}`, `GET /search`, `POST /link`, `GET /traverse`
- [x] FastMCP over stdio: `search`, `get`, `traverse`, `link`, `ingest`,
      `ingest_file` (server-local path); no connection opened at import time
- [x] pytest, all on `tmp_path`: ingest → search, link → traverse, duplicate
      ingest is a no-op, register-without-text then index, plus regression
      tests for the four skeleton bugs (thread affinity, FTS syntax crash,
      traverse off-by-one, chunk reassembly), API through TestClient, MCP
      through the in-process client
- [x] `.mcp.json` points at the venv interpreter (relative path,
      `PRAX_PYTHON` override); all six tools verified over stdio using that
      exact command. Confirm once more from a fresh Claude Code session
      (it reads `.mcp.json` only at startup).

## Stage 1 — Real sources and parsing

Goal: the existing Zotero library and live browser tabs flow into prax.
Parsing is a batch job; the serving path never parses.

- [x] Schema migrations (`src/prax/migrations/`, `PRAGMA user_version`)
      and a loaded, validated, versioned ontology (`prax.ontology`), so the
      store can grow past papers without re-ingesting (rationale R12)
- [x] Zotero test fixture: the items listed in `docs/sources.md`, copied
      from `R:\Zotero` into `tests/fixtures/zotero/` with a reduced
      `zotero.sqlite`; 5.5 MB, built by `scripts/make_zotero_fixture.py`
- [x] Zotero importer, `src/prax/importers/zotero.py` behind
      `scripts/import_zotero.py`: works on a copy of
      `zotero.sqlite` opened read-only; `--dry-run` prints an inventory
      (items by type, attachments by link mode, missing files, duplicate
      hashes) before anything is written. Maps items → documents with
      Zotero key, item type, creators, date, DOI, URL, abstract, tags and
      collection paths in `meta`; archives attachments by hash; indexes
      text straight from `.zotero-ft-cache` where present (98% of PDFs),
      tagged `meta.text_source`; imports notes as text documents;
      `--limit N` for trial runs. Idempotent on re-run.
- [x] Scratch run on C: (`PRAX_DATA_DIR=C:\prax-data`, about 27 GB):
      fixture, then `--limit 500`, then the full library. Review the
      dry-run report before each. (Result recorded in `docs/sources.md`.)
- [x] Parse queue, `scripts/parse_pending.py` over `prax.parsers`: every
      document with `parsed_at IS NULL` (`--pending`), and every document
      whose `meta.text_source` matches a prefix (`--upgrade`), is parsed by
      MIME type through a pluggable extractor registry (pymupdf4llm then
      pymupdf for PDF with fallback, explicit-only pymupdf4llm-ocr and
      docling, trafilatura for HTML, plain for text) and handed to
      `index_text`. Runs on the desktop, not the serving host.
- [x] Extractor decision: Docling versus pymupdf4llm on a table-heavy
      sample (`scripts/compare_extractors.py`, `docs/eval/`); verdict in
      rationale R8: pymupdf4llm stays the default, no Docling upgrade pass
- [x] Structure-aware chunks (migration 0002, `prax.chunking`, R13):
      kind, locator, heading path, table data; `search` filters by kind,
      `get_chunk` returns one chunk; `scripts/rechunk.py`
- [x] Upgrade pass over the cache-derived PDFs and HTML snapshots with the
      default extractors (`--upgrade zotero-ft-cache`): every text artifact
      now carries an extractor stamp and Markdown structure; 163 documents
      kept their cache text because the new extraction was shorter
      (`docs/sources.md`)
- [x] OCR pass over the scanned PDFs the bulk pass left empty
      (`--extractor pymupdf4llm-ocr`): 283 documents gained text, the rest
      is artwork or unreadable (`docs/sources.md`)
- [ ] The 71 scanned books (17 K pages): one deliberate overnight run with
      `PRAX_OCR_MAX_PAGES=1000`, or leave them until a faster OCR host
      exists
- [ ] Browser capture: a Manifest V3 extension (Chrome and Firefox) with
      "send this tab" and "send all tabs in window". Posts URL, title and the
      rendered DOM to `POST /ingest/html`; a URL-only `POST /ingest/url`
      fallback fetches server-side. Captures tagged with a capture-session
      id. Bearer token, reachable only over Tailscale.
- [ ] Inbox folder watcher: files dropped in `data/inbox/` are registered
      and queued for parsing
- [ ] Backfill of the old zoetrope disk: the hash inventory in
      `scripts/backfill.py` gains a `--commit` mode that registers files
      through the store; review the dedupe report first
- [x] Zotero-derived graph seeds: `authored_by` edges from creators, with
      `confidence = EXTRACTED` and `source_doc` set (part of the importer;
      one edge per paper title and author, notes excluded)

## Stage 2 — Hybrid retrieval

- [x] Embedding batch job: bge-small-en-v1.5 ONNX (384-dim) → `chunks_vec`
      (sqlite-vec 0.1.9, cosine, `kind` metadata column) through
      `prax.embeddings` and `scripts/embed_pending.py`; bookkeeping in
      `chunk_embeddings` (migration 0003); GPU via DirectML on the desktop,
      int8 on CPU. Full library: about 4.5 h at 53 chunks/s.
- [x] `search` is hybrid: FTS5 + vec in parallel, RRF fusion (k = 60),
      `mode=fts|vec` to force one side, degrades to FTS when vectors are
      absent; hits carry `fts_rank` and `vec_rank`
- [x] Eval harness: 20 hand-written queries against the Zotero fixture
      with expected docs (`tests/eval/queries.yaml`, `prax.evaluation`,
      `scripts/eval_retrieval.py`); first run in `docs/eval/`: hit@1 0.95
      fts, 0.90 vec and hybrid on the 10-document fixture
- [x] A larger eval set against the full store (expectations by title):
      62 queries, `tests/eval/queries-library.yaml`; FTS 0.82 MRR, vec
      0.81, hybrid 0.83 after document-level fusion (`docs/eval/`)
- [x] Vector index moved to a usearch HNSW file next to `prax.db`
      (`prax.vectors`, invariant 1 and R6 updated): 46 ms per query at
      recall 0.98 instead of sqlite-vec's 4 s; `chunk_embeddings` stays the
      bookkeeping; the batch job appends, saves and compacts
- [x] Optional cross-encoder rerank behind a flag (`prax.rerank`,
      `search(rerank=True)`, `PRAX_RERANK`): benchmarked MiniLM-L6 and
      bge-reranker-base at depths 10 and 30; none beats the fused list
      beyond noise and depth 30 hurts (`docs/eval/`). Off by default.
- [ ] Document-aware rerank input (title + heading path + chunk) as a
      follow-up experiment; the harness and flag are in place

## Stage 2b — Web UI

Goal: inspect and use the store without an agent. A client of the HTTP
door, nothing more: static files served by the same FastAPI process, a few
read endpoints for browsing, no framework and no build step (rationale
R14). Design in `docs/ui.md`.

- [x] Browsing endpoints on the door: `GET /documents` (paged, filtered
      by title, source, MIME), `GET /doc/{id}/original` (archived bytes
      with their MIME type, so a PDF opens in the browser at a page),
      `GET /doc/{id}/text` (the Markdown artifact), `GET /doc/{id}/chunks`
      (the document as its chunks with kind, heading, page, locator),
      `GET /entities?q=` (graph entry points)
- [x] Static UI mounted at `/ui/`: `src/prax/ui/` with one page, plain JS
      and CSS, a vendored Markdown renderer; hash routes `#search`,
      `#doc/<id>`, `#browse`, `#graph` (lookup and one-hop table for now)
- [x] Document view: metadata, the document rendered chunk by chunk with
      kind badges, heading path and page, the searched chunk highlighted
      and scrolled to, tables from their grids, an outline, "open
      original" at the chunk's page in a new tab
- [x] Search view: query, mode and kind, results with snippet, kind,
      heading, page and which side found them, each opening the document
      at that chunk
- [x] Browse view: recent and filtered document lists
- [x] Graph view: entity search, neighbourhood as an SVG force layout,
      expand by click, edges labelled with relation and confidence, source
      documents one click away
- [x] Review view: the queue paged, each item dropped, marked as an
      ontology gap, or linked as an edge after fixing types or relation
      (`GET /review`, `POST /review/{id}`, `GET /ontology`)
- [x] Bearer token on the door (`PRAX_TOKEN`, header or session cookie,
      loopback-only when unset; `prax.auth`) and a token prompt in the UI;
      Tailscale binding is a deployment step (`docs/howto.md`)

## Stage 3 — Graph enrichment

- [x] `ontology.yaml` v1: eight entity types, ten relations, descriptions
      written as extractor instructions (the prompt is generated from the
      file)
- [x] Extraction job (`prax.extraction`, `scripts/extract_graph.py`):
      structured output against the ontology's JSON schema, confidence and
      a quoted `evidence` per edge, `source_doc` + `ontology_version`
      stamped, misfits to `review_queue` (migration 0004), summary in
      `meta.summary`, incremental by `meta.extraction`; synchronous with a
      budget or via the Message Batches API. Dry-run estimate for the 8,448
      indexed documents: Opus 5 about $250 ($125 batch), Sonnet 5 $100
      ($50), Haiku 4.5 $50 ($25)
- [x] Trial run: 21 documents with Sonnet 5 (2026-09-09), 181 edges, 38
      review items, $0.71; Opus/Sonnet/Haiku compared on three papers
      (`docs/eval/local-llm-2026-09-08.md`); Sonnet 5 with a 20-triple cap
      chosen. Selection skips documents under 500 characters of text.
- [ ] Full run over the remaining 7,955 documents via the batch API
      (about $135 at the measured 2,500 output tokens per document)
- [x] Citation network (2026-09-10): `prax.importers.citations`, OpenAlex
      or Crossref by DOI or exact title, `cites` edges with evidence,
      citation counts in `meta.citations`; Crossref pass over the 1,069
      DOI documents
- [x] Graph overview by default (hubs, the edges among them and
      co-occurrence links); double click opens a neighbourhood
- [x] Document context column (2026-09-10): summary, entities, similar by
      vector centroid, shared entities, citations in and out, same
      authors, Zotero parent and siblings (`GET /doc/{id}/context`)
- [x] Extractor input widened: closing sections appended after the head
- [x] Review view: filters, bulk drop, replay against the ontology
      (`scripts/replay_review.py`)
- [x] Ontology v2 (2026-09-10, `docs/ontology-v2.md`): widened rules,
      `defines`/`contrasts`/`advised_by`; replay linked 377 queued
      triples, 170 typed items and 1,401 unmapped ones remain open
- [ ] Decide full re-run versus delta pass for the 1,021 documents
      extracted under v1 before the next batch
- [x] Code kept as code (2026-09-10): HTML `<pre>` blocks fenced, source
      attachments fenced by extension or Magika; extractor revisions in
      the stamp; 105 pages and 100 attachments re-parsed (48 and 11 code
      chunks where there was 1)
- [x] Local model option measured (`docs/eval/local-llm-2026-09-08.md`):
      llama-cpp-python CUDA wheel runs on the GTX 1070 (`prax.local_llm`,
      `local` extra, `scripts/bench_local_llm.py`); Qwen2.5-7B Q4 gives
      valid schema-constrained extractions at 80 s per document, a week
      of GPU time for the backlog against a $25-125 batch job, so the API
      stays the default for the bulk run
- [x] `LocalExtractor` (`PRAX_EXTRACT=local`, `PRAX_LOCAL_MODEL`): the
      same prompt and document input, answered as tab-separated lines
      under a bounded GBNF grammar (`prax.lineformat`, 20 triples, field
      lengths capped) so small models terminate; parsed into the same
      `Extraction`; runtime behind `prax.local_llm.LlamaRuntime`
- [x] Entity resolution (`prax.resolution`, `scripts/resolve_entities.py`):
      sure merges (normalized names, author initials forms) apply on their
      own, likely merges (name embeddings, concept/method/tool/dataset/venue
      only) go to an adjudicator (none, stub, or Claude); merges recorded
      via `entities.canonical_id` with chain flattening; `traverse` walks
      canonical ids. 264 author and title variants merged in the scratch
      store.
- [ ] Run the likely tier with the Claude adjudicator once extraction has
      produced concepts and methods to merge
- [x] Edge invalidation: `store.invalidate_edge` sets `valid_to` and can
      insert the successor edge (history kept); the contradiction pass
      that calls it comes with the second extraction round
- [x] `traverse` surfaces confidence, evidence, ontology version and
      validity on every edge (store, API and MCP)

## Later / maybe

- Streamable-HTTP MCP transport for remote access over Tailscale, and the
  MCP server proxying the HTTP door instead of importing the store
- Litestream replication of `data/prax.db`
- Kùzu migration script (only if the entity threshold is crossed)
- Complement / "blast-radius" SQL tools exposed via MCP
- Karakeep or Linkwarden as an additional capture front-end feeding the inbox
